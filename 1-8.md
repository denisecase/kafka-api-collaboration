# Process - Part 8 - Start the Java Apps

## 8.1 Start your consumer using the command provided. What directory must you be in to run this command as provided? Why?

Ans: 
- You can start Kafka consumer using the below command from C:\44517\kafka_2.12-2.4.1:
#### .\bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic bearcat-messages --from-beginning
- If there is any existing project: Open PowerShell here as Administrator in the root project folder, start the original consumer app using topic test and group1 using the below command:
#### java -cp target/kafka-api-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.spnotes.kafka.simple.Consumer test group1
- For Starting Custom producer Open PowerShell as Administrator in the root project folder, start the original consumer app: 
#### java -cp target/kafka-case-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar edu.nwmissouri.isl.bhagyasree2895.kafka.CustomConsumer
We need to run these commands from the above specified directories because When a consumer group is active, you can inspect partition assignments, groups and consumption progress from the command line using the consumer-groups.sh script, which is located in the bin directory of the Kafka distribution.

## 8.2 What topic is the consumer listening to? Where is this specicified?

Ans:
The consumer listening to "test".
It is specified after the topic and the command is below
.\bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test --from-beginning


## 8.3 What group is this consumer in? Where is this specicified?

Ans: In this the group of the consumer is group1 and it is specified after the topic name test


## 8.4 Start one of the producer apps using the command provided. What directory must you be in to run this command as provided? Why?

Ans: To start one of the producer apps it is recommended to be inside root directory of the application. To run the application we have to run the .jar file. After compiling our project Maven creates the .jar file in target folder after giving goal as package or install or deploy. To run this jar file either we can go to the root folder give the path of the jar file along with the class having main() method as argument to java -cp command. Other way is we change the directory from root to target and directly we can run the .jar file from target folder by invoking the by starting a Java runtime environment i.e giving java cammand and jar file as argument. 


## 8.5 What topic is the producer writing to? Where is this specicified?

Ans: The producer is writing to "test-message" which then the same will be listened in the consumer.
below command is used to specify the writing of the message.
.\bin\windows\kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test-message


## 8.6 If you wanted to change the topic name, what do you have to do? 

Ans: .\bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --create --topic bearcat-messages
This is the command for change of topic name.


## 8.7 Look at Consumer.java - what is it doing? Hint - what classes is it using? What methods are being called?

Ans:


## 8.8 Look at Producer.java - what is it doing? Explore the code.

Ans: I had explored the producer code present in simple folder in kafka-api provided to us. According to this code i had understood that after configuring the properties in producer file it is reading in the lines that are entered on the console and sending those to the consumer and these lines are nothing but the messages tranferred from producer to consumer.


## 8.9 Look at ProducerHello.java - what is it doing? How is it different from Producer?

Ans:


## 8.10 Look at ProducerSentence.java - what is it doing? How is it different from ProducerHello?

Ans:


## 8.11 Look at ProducerSentenceRandom.java - what is it doing? How is it different from the others?

Ans: The ProducerSentenceRandom is creating a random sentence by calling the private method create sentence by assigning the random numbers to the array and returning the random sentence from the stored string objects. It is different from others, as ProducerHello just returns the message hello and the ProducerSentence prints the sentence and whereas ProducerSentenceRandom prints the random sentences from defined set of strings. 


## 8.12 If you were asked to make a new custom producer, how would you start? 

Ans:
