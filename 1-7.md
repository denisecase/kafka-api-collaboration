# Process - Part 7 - Start the Services

## 7.1 Start a Zookeeper service. Keep the window open. What is the command? What directory must you be in to run this command as provided? Why?

Ans:
Command to start the Zookeeper service:
```
zkserver
```
We can run this command from any directory

Why, because we added the %ZOOKEEPER_HOME%\bin  to path variable in environment variables so that executable code of Zookeeper service is available from anywhere in the laptop

The above answer is correct and I reviewed the answer

The answer was correct path variable in surroundings variables so that executable code of Zookeeper provider is on hand from somewhere in the laptop.The steps outlined here run ZooKeeper in standalone mode. There is no replication, so if ZooKeeper process fails, the service will go down.
